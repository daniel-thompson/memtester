.SH NAME
memtester \- stress test to find memory subsystem faults.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B memtester
<\fIMEMORY\fR>
[\fIITERATIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
memtester is an effective userspace tester for stress-testing the memory
subsystem.  It is very effective at finding intermittent and non-deterministic
faults.  Note that problems in other hardware areas (overheating CPU, 
out-of-specification power supply, etc.) can cause memory faults.
.PP
memtester will malloc(3) the amount of memory specified, if possible.  If
this fails, it will decrease the amount of memory requested until it succeeds.
It will then attempt to mlock(3) this memory; if it cannot do so, testing
will be slower and less effective.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fIMEMORY\fR
the amount of memory to allocate and test, in megabytes
